# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week2: Machine Learning, warming up

This week's class is a hands on practice session. The objective is to work on multiple examples, play with the data, discuss what are good/bad practices for handling the data, and also run few simple learning models, without being obsessed about the performance for the time being.
